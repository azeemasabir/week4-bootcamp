# 📝 1. To-Do List App Overview

## ⚙️ Project Structure

```
todo-flask/
│── app.py       # main app (or app + routes split)
│── models.py    # Task model (id, title, done)
│── routes.py    # (if separated) all endpoints
│── templates/
│     ├── index.html  # main UI (list tasks, add task, buttons)
```

## 🔄 Flow

1. **User visits `/`**
   → `index()` route runs → fetches all `Task` objects from DB → passes to `index.html`.

2. **Add new task**

   * User types title in form → submits to `/add` (POST).
   * `add()` route creates a new `Task` in DB → redirects back to `/`.

3. **Mark as done**

   * User clicks “Done” → `/done/<id>` runs.
   * That updates the `done` field to `True` → saves to DB → reloads `/`.

4. **Delete task**

   * User clicks “Delete” → `/delete/<id>` runs.
   * That deletes the task from DB → reloads `/`.

# 💰 2. Expense Tracker App Overview

## ⚙️ Project Structure

```
expense-tracker/
│── app.py         # creates Flask app and DB
│── models.py      # Expense model (id, amount, category, desc, date)
│── routes.py      # all routes (index, add, delete, report)
│── templates/
│     ├── layout.html  # base layout
│     ├── index.html   # dashboard
│     └── report.html  # charts
```

## 🔄 Flow

1. **User visits `/` (Dashboard)**

   * `index()` route checks query param `month`.
   * Fetches expenses from DB for that month.
   * Passes list + total to `index.html`.

2. **Add expense**

   * Form POSTs to `/add`.
   * `add()` route validates input, saves to DB, redirects to `/`.

3. **Delete expense**

   * `/delete/<id>` finds and deletes the record, reloads dashboard.

4. **Reports**

   * `/report?month=YYYY-MM` runs queries:

     * **Pie Chart**: expenses grouped by category.
     * **Line Chart**: expenses grouped by day.
   * Sends that data to `report.html`.
   * Chart.js renders interactive graphs.
